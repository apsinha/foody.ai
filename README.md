This is a flash app that asks some basic questions about the users' demographics and dietary preferences
The app then calls GPT4 to create a mealplan for the user designed from local, seasonal ingredients, and keeping in mind their dietary preferences
The meals in the plan are available for order as ingredients in Instacart (using Instacart GPT4 plugin)
Future work: integrate Doordash, local farm box options and celebrity nutritionist coaches
